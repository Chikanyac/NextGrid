        <p>Regular maintenance can drastically improve your computer's performance. With a few simple steps, you can clean your hardware, update your software, and optimize startup programs.</p>

        <h2>1. Clean Your Hardware</h2>
        <p>Dust and debris block airflow and can cause overheating. Wipe down your PC, use compressed air on fans, and ensure all components are dust-free.</p>

        <h2>2. Update Your Software</h2>
        <p>Keep your operating system, drivers, and apps up to date. Remove software you no longer use to free resources.</p>

        <h2>3. Optimize Startup Programs</h2>
        <p>Too many programs launching at startup slows your PC. Disable unnecessary startup items via Task Manager (Windows) or Login Items (Mac).</p>

         <h2>4. Manage Disk Space</h2>
        <p>Delete temporary files and old downloads. DUninstall apps you no longer use.</p>

         <h2>5. Monitor Performance</h2>
        <p>Use Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) to check CPU, RAM, and disk usage. Identify apps that slow down your PC and take action.</p>

        <h2>Bonus Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Run disk cleanup to free space.</li>
            <li>Scan regularly for viruses and malware.</li>

        </ul>
